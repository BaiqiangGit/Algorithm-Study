### Prewords

What I cannot create, I do not understand ---- Richard Feynman

What I cannot create fast, I do not really understand. Mastering **1** thing is more difficult than knowing **1000** things. Top fruits need deep roots. Only when enough hours have been paid could you become master. Repeat and repeat, with hand and mind.
